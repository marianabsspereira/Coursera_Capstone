    "In recent years, the city of Porto has been receiving more and more tourists, which has forced residents to move to areas further away from the city center. Since the growth of tourism in the city happened at an accelerated pace, the necessary infrastructures in the most peripheral areas still do not exist to meet the needs of residents, particularly with regard to supermarkets. Thus, this project aims to find the best area in Porto to build a new supermarket."
